Lecture 
Binary language 0s and 1s 	--> Machine Code (numbers, letters, instructions)
Humans write			--> Source Code
We focus on the higher level
Problem to solve: going from Source Code to Machine Code
General algorithm  	input --> 			--> output
			source code --> compiler	--> machine code

Scratch - turned puzzle pieces into Machine Code
Compiler - allows us to convert Source code in c to Machine Cod
now this power moves to the human doing the conversion
Thus we write Good Code 
correctness, design, style
	is it correct? does it do what its supposed to do?
	more subjective: design better by using loops instead of copying, pasting
		better designed means its faster
		better designed means the ideas get communicated better
	style: asthetics, computer does not care but the human does
